</p>

AscEnd is a **GwAu3 Pre-Searing automation script** designed to efficiently level a character to 20 for the highly coveted title  
**Legendary Defender of Ascalon (LDoA)**.

Rather than being a single-purpose bot, **AscEnd acts as a hub of farms**, allowing multiple leveling routes and activities to be run from one central script.

The name **AscEnd** reflects the goal: level fast, no faff — and yes, it’s also a cheeky nod to what eventually happens to Ascalon.

## 🧭 Current Farms

AscEnd currently includes the following Pre-Searing farms:

- **Charr at the Gate**
- **Farmer Hamnet**
- **Run to Outposts** (excluding Piken Square)
- **Red Iris Flower Farm**
- **Unnatural Seeds Farm**
- **More farms on the way**

Each farm is modular and designed to plug directly into the AscEnd hub.

---

## 🧩 How AscEnd Works

- AscEnd runs as a **central controller**
- Individual farms are stored as separate scripts
- All farms follow a shared structure so they can be managed consistently

This design makes AscEnd easy to extend, maintain, and contribute to.
